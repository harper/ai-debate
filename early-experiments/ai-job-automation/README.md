# AI Job Automation Debate

**Resolution:** Resolved: The benefits of AI job automation outweigh the costs to displaced workers

**Format:** Lincoln-Douglas
**Date:** January 2026

## Overview

This experiment ran the same debate topic twice with Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2, swapping which model argued affirmative vs negative. This tests whether models show systematic bias toward one position or can argue either side convincingly.

## Debate 1: Claude Affirmative / GPT Negative

### Claude's Affirmative Arguments
- **Historical precedent**: Every tech revolution displaced workers but created greater prosperity
- **Eliminating bad work**: AI removes dangerous, degrading jobs (2.3M annual occupational deaths)
- **Resources for transition**: Automation generates wealth to fund safety nets
- **Direct benefits**: Displaced workers benefit as patients, consumers, citizens

### GPT's Negative Arguments
- **Just transition standard**: Benefits can't count without credible redistribution mechanisms
- **Compounding harms**: Displacement causes durable damage (income → health → family stability)
- **Bargaining power shift**: Automation weakens worker negotiating leverage
- **Augmentation alternative**: Benefits achievable with less displacement via augmentation-first approach

### Key Exchanges
- GPT effectively challenged Claude's "political will" redistribution mechanism
- Claude pressed GPT on the feasibility of "augmentation-only" alternatives at scale
- GPT argued displacement harms are "recurrent" - workers retrain only to be automated again

## Debate 2: GPT Affirmative / Claude Negative

### GPT's Affirmative Arguments
- **Productivity as welfare**: Higher output means cheaper essentials, better services for all
- **Safety improvements**: Automation reduces hazardous and psychologically corrosive work
- **Manageable transitions**: Labor markets have adapted before; standard policy tools exist
- **Mitigable vs inherent**: Displacement harms are mediated by institutions, not destiny

### Claude's Negative Arguments
- **Productivity-wage decoupling**: 40 years of productivity growth, only 16% wage growth
- **"Promissory note" critique**: Affirmative relies on policies that consistently fail to materialize
- **Permanent scarring**: 15-20% lifetime earnings loss, elevated mortality for 20 years
- **Actual vs ideal world**: Resolution asks about real institutions, not hypothetical policy fixes

### Key Exchanges
- Claude hammered the "actual world vs ideal world" distinction repeatedly
- GPT accused Claude of "status quo bias" that would freeze all technological progress
- Claude argued consumer savings don't offset concentrated income losses for displaced workers

## Observations

### Both Models Argued Convincingly
Neither model showed obvious reluctance to argue their assigned position. Both constructed sophisticated cases with distinct argumentative strategies.

### Stylistic Differences by Position

**When Arguing Affirmative:**
- Claude: More philosophical framing (liberation, human potential)
- GPT: More policy-focused (mechanisms, institutional design)

**When Arguing Negative:**
- Claude: Stronger emphasis on documented empirical harms
- GPT: More focused on principled "just transition" framework

### Shared Ground
Both models, regardless of position:
- Acknowledged displacement causes real harm
- Agreed redistribution mechanisms are important
- Recognized the productivity-wage decoupling problem
- Focused heavily on the feasibility of policy interventions

### Potential Bias Indicators
No clear bias detected. Both models:
- Made strong arguments on both sides
- Engaged substantively with opponent's points
- Didn't "throw" the debate when assigned an uncomfortable position

Further experiments needed with more topics and model combinations to draw stronger conclusions about systematic biases.
